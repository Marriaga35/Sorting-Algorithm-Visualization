**About Sorting Algorithm Visualization:**

Sorting Algorithm Visualization is a program for enterprises to load data files and run sort algorithms to compare what algorithm maximizes efficiency. Provides user to make decisions on what works best according to business needs.


**Background:**

Businesses have to make a lot of decisions based on data that they are presented with. Which includes major decisions like company finances, labor tracking, and  inventory control. With the functions provided by this program cost cutting could save a company a lot of money. Sorting a list of items manually can take a long time and this is especially true is one is working with a large list. However, sorting algorithms can be created to make this sorting of data much easier. An efficient sorting algorithm is necessary for one to carry out other operations on a dataset such as searching or modification. In addition, sorting a dataset allows it to be more easily read and interpreted by the user.


**Proposed Solution:**

There is already a wide variety of popular sorting algorithms. These include: Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, etc. However, the goal for this project is to determine which of these sorting methods is most efficient. The program is designed to operate as easy as possible. Minimize little to no training needed. Easy instructions/help menu to keep things simple. So focus is strictly on the important data and visualization of the graph's results. Print graph function so that the user could provide if needed in a presentation.


**Running the Application:**

The application is downloaded to the local machine. It's a runnable jar file that can either be ran by clicking on the jar file or implemented through the native computer's terminal.

**Input Parameters**

There are no external input parameters from the user which are required. All necessary inputs are available through the program itself. The user simply need to select the sorting method of his or her choice followed by a typing in a value for sorting size and speed. Afterward, the user just needs to press start and the program will begin executing.

**Unit Test**

**Test Procedure:**

**Generate Dataset**

-Pass/Fail Criteria: The test passes if the system successfully displays a randomly generated dataset over the user menu.

-Input Data: N/A

-Expected Results:
Displays Random Array in graph


**Test Procedure:**

**Start Button**

-Pass/Fail Criteria: The test passes if the system successfully runs the chosen sort method and displays the final sorted array.

-Input Data: N/A

-Expected Results:
1. Sort Method runs
2. Displayed array will run/move concurrently
3. Final sorted array displayed with final information


**Test Procedure:**

**Save Button**

-Pass/Fail Criteria: The test passes if the system successfully saves an image of the report in an archive.

-Input Data: N/A

-Expected Results:

The system displays a “Report Saved” message to the user.


**Test Procedure:**

**Help Button**

-Pass/Fail Criteria: The test passes if the system successfully transitions from the Main menu to the Help Menu.

-Input Data: N/A

-Expected Results:

Help information displays to the user.
